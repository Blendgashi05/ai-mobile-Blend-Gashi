So im using replit, supabase the URL and anon key are in the .env file, and GitHub, the plan is to create a mobile app for grocery shopping list, it needs to have CRUD, auth , good structure and documentation and sleek design, what i need from you is to generate me a good prompt for replit keep it short and understandable 
Email/password Auth (login, signup, logout).

CRUD for shopping lists + items (add, edit, delete, mark as bought).

Clean folder structure: lib/screens, lib/services, lib/widgets, lib/models.

Supabase service for all DB operations.

Sleek, modern UI with consistent theming and reusable components.

Error handling, loading states, and input validation.

Include clear documentation in README: setup steps, environment variables, running instructions.

Code should be production-ready, clean, and commented.
